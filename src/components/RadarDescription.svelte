    <h3>Meaning of rings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> - we are good at this matter, this is the company's core.</li>
      <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> - things that are researched. They have been used in an internal project or maybe even
        in a commercial
        one. Creating PoC is also qualifying a given platform or technology to the trail ring. The important thing is
        that we shifted from the "thinking" stage to "doing".
      </li>
      <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> - we want to check a given technology/platform, we have not used it in the commercial
        or internal projects yet, we are just thinking about it.
      </li>
      <li><strong>HOLD</strong> - we used it, but we don't want to work with a given technology/platform anymore.</li>
